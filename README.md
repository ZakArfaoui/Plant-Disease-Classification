# 🌿 Plant Disease Classification

This project applies **deep learning techniques** to classify plant leaf diseases using multiple state-of-the-art **optimization algorithms** — including **AdaBelief**, **AdamW**, **LAMB**, and **Lion**.  
The goal is to evaluate how different optimizers impact convergence, accuracy, and generalization on plant disease datasets such as *PlantVillage*.

## 🧠 Project Overview
Plant diseases can drastically reduce crop yields and food quality.  
This project uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Vision Transformers (ViT)** to automatically identify diseases from leaf images.  
Each notebook explores how different optimizers affect model training behavior and performance.

## ⚙️ Optimizers Included
| Optimizer | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **AdaBelief** | Adaptive method that combines fast convergence and strong generalization. |
| **AdamW** | Adam variant with decoupled weight decay for better regularization. |
| **LAMB** | Layer-wise Adaptive Moments optimizer designed for large-batch training. |
| **Lion** | Momentum-free optimizer using sign gradients for simplicity and speed. |
